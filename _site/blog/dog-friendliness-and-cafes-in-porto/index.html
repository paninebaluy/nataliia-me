<p>I was filming a video circle for my friends with my dog lying inside a caf√© while people stroked her head, and I realized that I had never written this post.</p>

<p>Portugal likes dogs. Maybe it‚Äôs even too lenient toward dog owners who frequently refuse to clean up.</p>
<p>But if you go to any caf√© around the city, you‚Äôll encounter the obligatory red crossed-out dog sign. It‚Äôs the standard.</p>
<p>But pet-friendliness doesn‚Äôt work here like in other countries. Like in many other areas, it‚Äôs very personal: you need to communicate and make friends. If the establishment owner knows you and your dog, there is a high chance that you will be allowed inside together.</p>
<p>This is especially true for popular local caf√©s/bars/churrasqueiras 3-in-1 with dim lighting, an obligatory TV, an optional pimba in the background, and a wide selection of ice cream and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Plus, you can always use the esplanada ‚Äî the tables outside. It‚Äôs also the unwritten rule that dogs are always welcome there, climate permitting you to use it all year long.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve lived in two bairros (small districts) in Porto: Lordelo do Ouro and Aldoar. In both, I easily managed to find establishments that were absolutely OK with my dog (and larger dogs) inside. I see two main provisions for this:</p>
<p>You are open for communication and friendly, and always say hello to the owner passing by.
Your dog is friendly and not aggressive.
In addition, there are a couple of projects about dog-friendliness that I encountered.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dogallowed.com/">https://dogallowed.com/</a> collects places that are dog-friendly by default. For now, it looks like it only has places in Lisbon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/petfriendly_pt">https://www.instagram.com/petfriendly_pt</a> ‚Äî a project that is more of an advertising site for short stays. I hope it will grow into something more useful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S: <em>Mais uma‚Ä¶</em> I mean, a bonus illustration for this post. This is at Caf√© Gomil (Matosinhos).</p>
