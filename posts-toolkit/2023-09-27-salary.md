If you are weird and desperate enough to consider an offer from a Portuguese company, you can calculate your future net salary here:

Standard practice is to include meal allowance into the net sum offered to you by the HR because it makes the sum look more attractive. Meal allowance can typically be spent on food — like supermarkets or cafés, and it’s not subject to IRS (taxes) or payments to Segurança Social (more taxes).

BTW, I recommend that you play with larger sums and see the cost of employment for the company — one of the main reasons why the salaries here are so low.
