So turns out I’ve been to Guimarães for the sixth time already. Somehow, I feel the need to drag everyone I know there.

Bad news:

- Last year’s program with free attendance of museums for Portuguese residents on weekends before 14h seems to have ended.

- The castle has even more territory cordoned off for restoration: the first floor and a major part of the ground floor are off-limits.
- 
The good news is that now you need only one ticket to see the Paço de Duques de Branganca, Castelo, and Igreja for 5 euros.
