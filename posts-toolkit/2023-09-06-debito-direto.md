I just realised that this is not evident to everyone. so.

If you signed up for a Portuguese service that regularly takes your money via debito direto, you could cancel the payments through an online service of your bank. no need to call the service provider and ask them kindly, trying to get through the low-tier call centre staff who want to hold on to your payments.

Here is the screenshot of the Direct Debits interface of Novobanco, for instance. just view the details and cancel âœ¨

P.S.: But make sure you can just cancel it in case, you know, contract penalties.
