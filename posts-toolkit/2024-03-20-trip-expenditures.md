I’ve been travelling by car a lot lately. I’ll be honest, travel in Portugal without a car is kind of a pain in the ass. Buses are ok, trains a great but late, but most cool places are kind of inaccessible without personal wheels.

There are two services I use to plan trips on my small three-door trusty Pupsik car.

1. [Calculador de Portagens](https://www.viaverde.pt/empresas/ferramentas/calculador-de-portagens) by Via Verde.
    Do NOT use the one by Infraestrururas de Portugal; it lies shamelessly.

2. I also use [Waze app](https://www.waze.com/) to do the same. Sometimes Waze is even more precise.

3. [Maisgasolina](https://www.maisgasolina.com/) to look for the cheapest gasoline on my way. Portugal’s gas stations sometimes have a pretty wild price variety. *95 simples* is much cheaper in Trás-os-Montes for some reason.

**Important P.S.:**

Never forget.

- *Gasolina* — gasoline.
- *Gasóleo* — diesel.
