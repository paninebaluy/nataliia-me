*O que √© isso?*

It‚Äôs a question I often ask in the bakeries, then promptly forget what they answer me.

I am a kind of a bread and pastry aficionado. I like all things bready and care more about the biscuit than the filling. If you offered me a choice between chocolate or a piece of freshly baked bread, I‚Äôd choose the second every time.

This is where I feel in real harmony with Portugal. Only tourists think that Portugal is all about fish and past√©is de nata, while it is actually about meat, beans, and bread.

So, ok, new tag, new content. Food!

## Fidalguinhos de Braga

Also called just ‚Äúfidalguinhos‚Äù or ‚Äúfidalgos‚Äù. This is a thin oval pastry made of wheat flour, egg, butter, lemon zest, and cinnamon. Sometimes it has a slightly different shape, like two crossed legs.

If you are a fan of *solomka* (very specific slightly sweet thin pastry), you‚Äôll probably like this one, although fidalguinhos are sweeter.

## Where to buy them in Porto?
