Viva, malta!

I am Natália (at least, that's how Câmara Municipal do Porto writes my name, and who am I to judge their attempts to portuguese me).

I am Ukrainian, and I've lived here since July 2022. I work for a Portuguese company and plan on starting my own business.
I speak Portuguese and use it mainly to talk to other dog owners and friends. And I walk my adorable corgi Freyja around Aldoar twice a day.

Bem-vindos!
