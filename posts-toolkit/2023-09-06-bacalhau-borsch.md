And not really Porto-related.

A really nice guy and journalist Luís Ribeiro is going to cook borsch with bacalhau as a symbol of their union with his Ukrainian wife.

Wife is scandalized. I slightly disagree, because I’ve known and tasted fish and mushroom borsch. Hard not to, when your soup selection in the national cuisine is mostly divided into borsch or yushka — and, depending on the season and the presence of a Christian fast, they can contain basically anything. Yushka can’t be red or green though. except sometimes.

You can leave your cod borsch recipe suggestions under his post here:
